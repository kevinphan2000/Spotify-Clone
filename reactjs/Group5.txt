The confidence interval (CI) is a range of values that includes a population value with a 
certain degree of confidence. It is expressed a % whereby a population means lies between 
an upper and lower interval

The 95% confidence interval is a range of values that you can be 95% certain contains the true 
mean of the population. As the sample size increases, the range of interval values will narrow
The mean with more accuracy compared with a smaller sample.

There is 5% chance that the population mean lies outside of upper and lower confidence interval


Why do researcher use confidence intervals?

selecting sample or subgroup of the population

The researcher can estimate the parameters of a population, the estimated range being calculated
from a given set of sample data. 
The confidnece interval is to measeure how well the sample represent the population 

Two factor affecting the result: the sample size, the amount of vairiation in data -> variation can influence the design of sample survey

E(y) = mill and E(Ny) = T 

SRS:
a sample of size n is drawn from a population of size N such that every sample of size n has
the same chance of being selected. The sample is called a simple random sample



Startified > Systematic > Simple > Cluster

Stratified sample all sample elements within a group (homomogenous): separaring the population elements into groups, 
strate and each element in one stratum and independently selecting a SRS 
for each stratum. Advantages:
- variance is reduced 
- the cost of collecting is reduced 
- seperate estimates obtained for individual strata 


Cluster sample few cluster parts group include all element in a group (not homomgenous)

Systematic sampling is alternative to simple rrandom sampling. eaiser to perform less subjecy to interviewer errors than SRS.
